# Monty-Hall

A Python simulation of the classic **Monty Hall problem**, demonstrating how often you win if you **always switch** your choice after the host reveals an empty door.

This code allows you to:
- analyze single Monty Hall games (probability of winning),
- simulate **multi-round matches** (e.g. 15 games per match)
